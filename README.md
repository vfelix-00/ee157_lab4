# Lab 4: Magnetic Forces and Materials Lab

## Overview
The objectives of this lab are to experimentally observe and measure electromechanical force production through the use of a linear solenoid actuator, and to characterize the B-H loop of two materials (ferrite and steel).

We studied electromechanical force production through the use of a linear solenoid actuator. The linear solenoid actuator consists of a coil, a steel frame, and a steel plunger. When the coil is energized, the plunger is pulled into the coil. In this lab, solenoids illustrate the principles of force production very directly. The frame and plunger complete a magnetic path very similar to a pair of “E” cores when the plunger is pulled all the way into the coil. As the plunger pulls out, the gap is gradually increased and the inductance decreases. To calculate the force, we can use the change of inductance with position.
