# Lab 4: Magnetic Forces and Materials Lab

Vanessa Felix
Partner: Vivian Auduong

## Overview
The objectives of this lab are to experimentally observe and measure electromechanical force production through the use of a linear solenoid actuator, and to characterize the B-H loop of two materials (ferrite and steel).
