## Solenoid Measurement and Analysis

### Overview
The objectives of this lab are to experimentally observe and measure electromechanical force production through the use of a linear solenoid actuator, and to characterize the B-H loop of two materials (ferrite and steel).

We studied electromechanical force production through the use of a linear solenoid actuator. The linear solenoid actuator consists of a coil, a steel frame, and a steel plunger. When the coil is energized, the plunger is pulled into the coil. In this lab, solenoids illustrate the principles of force production very directly. The frame and plunger complete a magnetic path very similar to a pair of “E” cores when the plunger is pulled all the way into the coil. As the plunger pulls out, the gap is gradually increased and the inductance decreases. To calculate the force, we can use the change of inductance with position.

- Impedance Analyzer for Analog Discovery
- Tape
- Ruler
- Pliers

### Procedure 

1. We gathered the above materials for the set up.
2. With the spring still attached,the solenoid was hooked up to the power supply. This was to see how they are supposed to work. The power supply was set to 12V and the coils were energized since these solenoids are designed to operate at 12 V. The voltage was lowered until the plunger no longer retracted.
3. The spring was removed to take our measurements. The retaining ring was carefully removed with a pair of pliers. Safety glasses were worn while doing this.
4. We tried to get a feel for the forces involved once the spring was removed. We started out at a lower voltage of about 3V and observed what happened when the power supply was turned on. We then tried pulling on the plunger from when it was fully retracted and the coil was energized.
5. The plunger was held at an extended position, then the supply was turned on. The plunger was moved through its range while the coil was energized. We got a feel for the force as we let the plunger retract.
6. The voltage was gradually increased to 12 V and then we got a feel for how the force changed as the current through the coil increased.
